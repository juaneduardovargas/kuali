## Name

Kuali

## Summary

Transcribe Google Meet locally with Kuali. Teams and Zoom support is experimental and partial.

## Detailed description

Kuali turns browser meetings into speaker-aware, searchable notes without
adding a recording bot to the call.

Google Meet support is stable. Microsoft Teams and Zoom support is experimental
and partial while those integrations receive broader real-world testing.

Start capture from the toolbar, review the data disclosure, and confirm that
participants have been informed. Kuali then sends meeting audio directly to
the companion desktop app on the same computer. Whisper transcribes speech
locally and Kuali shows a persistent recording indicator until capture stops.

Features:

- live transcription in the Kuali desktop app;
- participant names and separate speaker channels when the meeting platform
  exposes them;
- optional local participant WAV tracks, visible-tab WebM recording, and
  sanitized capture diagnostics;
- simultaneous capture from multiple supported meeting tabs;
- automatic stop when you leave or the meeting ends;
- local meeting history, search, summaries, decisions, open questions, and
  action items; and
- optional user-configured AI providers and webhooks.

The free, open-source Kuali desktop app is required. The extension connects
only to Kuali on `127.0.0.1`; it has no Kuali-operated cloud backend and does
not retain media in extension storage. The desktop app retains audio, visible
tab video, or diagnostics only when you enable those local options. Those
files never go to an AI provider or webhook; transcripts leave the computer
only when you configure a summary provider, Discord delivery, or a webhook.

Meeting services may change their private browser interfaces. Teams and Zoom
may have incomplete capture, participant identity, or speaker separation in
some meeting modes. Kuali labels unavoidable mixed audio instead of assigning
it to the wrong person.

Always tell participants and obtain any consent required in your location.
Kuali is not affiliated with Google, Microsoft, or Zoom.
