# Kuali Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** August 8, 2026
**Español:** [PRIVACY.es.md](PRIVACY.es.md)

Kuali is an open-source, self-hosted meeting transcription application. This
policy covers the Kuali desktop application, Discord bot, and Kuali browser
extension distributed from this repository.

## The short version

Kuali does not operate an account service, advertising network, analytics
service, or cloud transcription backend. The browser extension sends meeting
audio and participant information only to the Kuali application running on
your own computer. Whisper transcribes that audio locally. Kuali does not sell
personal information. Audio tracks, screen capture, and technical diagnostics
are retained only when you explicitly enable those local settings.

If you configure a summary provider, Discord delivery, or a webhook, the
desktop application sends the data described below to that service at your
request. Those services have their own privacy policies.

## Information Kuali processes

When you choose to record and transcribe a supported browser meeting, Kuali may
process:

- live meeting audio;
- the meeting platform, meeting identifier, page title, and start/end times;
- participant display names, usernames, platform identifiers, avatar URLs,
  mute state, speaking activity, and whether an audio channel is separate or
  mixed; and
- the resulting speaker-attributed transcript, confidence values, summary,
  key points, decisions, open questions, and action items.

For Discord calls, the desktop application may process the equivalent server,
channel, participant, voice, and message-delivery information required to join
the call, attribute speakers, announce recording, and deliver results.

Kuali also stores settings you enter, which may include a Discord bot token,
Discord username or user ID, model location, special vocabulary, summary
provider settings and API keys, and webhook URLs and signing secrets. The
browser extension itself stores only the local port, pairing code, and the
remembered meeting-video preference used to configure each capture.

## How information is used

Kuali uses this information only to:

- capture a meeting you explicitly start;
- show live participants and transcription;
- create and search a local meeting record;
- generate a title, summary, decisions, questions, and action items;
- deliver results to Discord or user-configured webhooks; and
- diagnose capture status and keep simultaneous meetings separate.

Kuali does not use meeting data for advertising, credit decisions, profiling,
or training a Kuali-operated machine-learning model.

## Where information goes

Browser meeting data travels from the meeting page to the extension and then
over a loopback WebSocket (`127.0.0.1`) to the Kuali desktop application on the
same computer. The local service rejects ordinary website origins. The
extension does not send this data to a Kuali-operated server.

Whisper transcription runs locally. Depending on settings you choose:

- a configured OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI-compatible, or command-line
  summary provider receives meeting metadata, participant display names, and
  the transcript needed to generate the summary, and, when someone asks a
  question about past meetings, the excerpts selected to answer it;
- Discord receives notices, summaries, tasks, and transcripts you request the
  bot to post; and
- each enabled webhook receives the completed-meeting payload, including
  meeting/channel metadata, participants, transcript, summary, and tasks.

Kuali does not enable these destinations on your behalf. Review the privacy
terms of each service before configuring it.

## Storage, retention, and deletion

The desktop application stores meeting records in the operating system's Kuali
application-data directory and settings in its Kuali configuration directory.
Downloaded speech-model weights are stored in `~/.kuali` by default or in the
folder you select. On Unix systems, Kuali writes its configuration file with
owner-only (`0600`) permissions; secrets are not additionally encrypted at
rest.

Alongside those records, Kuali keeps a local search index derived from them, so
questions about past meetings can be answered without reading every file. It
contains no information the meeting records do not already hold, it never leaves
your computer, and deleting a meeting removes it from the index as well.

Meeting records remain until you delete them in Kuali or remove their files.
Model weights remain until you delete them in Kuali. Removing the extension
deletes its browser-managed local port, pairing code, and meeting-video
preference according to the browser's normal extension-data behavior. Data
already delivered to Discord, a summary provider, or a webhook is controlled
by that service and must be deleted there.

By default, captured PCM audio is processed in memory and disappears when
processing ends or the application closes. If you enable local media retention,
Kuali stores aligned participant WAV tracks, a WebM capture of the visible
meeting tab with mixed output audio, and/or sanitized diagnostic JSONL inside
that meeting's application-data directory. These files remain until you delete
the meeting or remove its directory; Kuali does not send them to summary
providers or webhooks.

## Recording notice and consent

Kuali requires the person starting browser capture to confirm that participants
were informed and that they have permission to record and transcribe. It also
shows a persistent recording indicator. Laws and platform rules vary by
location; the person operating Kuali is responsible for obtaining every
required consent.

## Security

Kuali limits the browser bridge to the loopback interface, restricts browser
origins to Chrome extensions, requests access only to supported meeting sites,
and ships all extension code in its package. Because Kuali is software running
on your computer, anyone who can access your account, files, configured tokens,
or enabled destinations may be able to access meeting information.

## Chrome Web Store Limited Use

Kuali's use and transfer of information received from Google services complies
with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including its Limited Use
requirements. Kuali uses data from Google Meet only to provide the
user-visible capture, transcription, meeting library, summary, and delivery
features described in this policy.

## Changes and contact

Material changes will be documented in this file and its effective date will be
updated. Questions, privacy requests, and security reports can be opened at
<https://github.com/igarrux/kuali/issues>. Do not include meeting content,
tokens, API keys, or other secrets in a public issue.
