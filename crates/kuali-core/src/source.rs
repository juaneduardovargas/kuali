//! Events reported by an audio source to the engine.
//!
//! Kuali accepts Discord voice channels and, through the browser extension,
//! Meet, Teams, and Zoom. Every source emits per-channel audio with a bound
//! participant identity.
//!
//! This vocabulary lives outside `kuali-discord` so sources never depend on one
//! another. The engine consumes a single `VoiceEvent` stream, allowing
//! segmentation, Whisper, storage, and summaries to work uniformly.
